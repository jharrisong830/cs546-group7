Below is an outline of the database structure of Tweeter. **Currently, this is only a proposal, and this document will be updated to reflect changes to the database as the project progresses**.

There will be two main collections for our database. **Users** will store identifying info for individual users, external API authentication data, and their relationships to other objects. **Posts** contain a large amount of subdocuments, as they will feature the majority of the content for our app. Each post can be associated with a "music item" subdocument, which can be a playlist, song, or album. Users can leave comments on posts, and additionally leave ratings on playlists.
